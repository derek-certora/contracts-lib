# My Personal Library of Ethereum Smart Contracts

A personal library of contracts for experimentation with formal specification. Not to be relied on for anything at all.

Library includes:
- [ERC20](erc20/) token contract
- [custodian](custodian/) contract, a toy contract which takes custody of a user's ERC20 tokens
- [toy-trade](toy-trade/) contract, a toy trading contract between two ERC20 token contracts
